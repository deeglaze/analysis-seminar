Notes for Shivers' Spring 2013 graduate seminar for program analysis.

This repository is intended to be contributed to over the course of
the seminar in order to consolidate knowledge and decrease repeated
work of each participant. I hope the resulting product is a somewhat
self-contained document on the preliminaries as well as some advanced
areas of program analysis.

Run make to build the seminar notes.
